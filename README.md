## Make Change Homework
From the user side the the program is very simple. You are prompted for the total of what you intend to purchase. The program will then ask you how you intend to pay. Both of these numbers must be positive doubles or 2 place decimal numbers. In the event you attempt to enter another type number you will be met with a friendly error message explaining why you can't enter the amount you chose. If you chose a negative number, you will be prompted for a new number until you provide a workable value. If the value contains too many places beyond the decimal point, the program will round this value.

From there the program will inquire as to how the total or bill will be paid. The same rules apply to the payment. This number must be positive and a 2 place decimal number. If other values are input, the program acts similarly to how it did in the first prompt. Negative values will be prompted for a new value and more specific values will be rounded to the hundreths place.

The program then compares the two values given to determine if the payment is sufficient.
